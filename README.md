# EoE's Encoding Projects.

A collection of my (readable) Vapoursynth scripts. All future projects will be committed here, with
past projects possibly getting added slowly assuming I can clean them up.

- *.vpy -> Vapoursynth Scripts
- *.ini -> Start-BatchJudasEncode config files.

## Dependancies

Dependancies for all projects can be installed automatically using the
[Judas Vapoursynth Install Script](https://blog.eoe.codes/assets/vapoursynth-installation/Vapoursynth%20Install.7z)
(more info on [my blog](https://blog.eoe.codes/vapoursynth%20scripting/2022/04/09/installing-vapoursynth.html))

If you just want a list of the most used however,

- [EoEfunc@master](https://github.com/End-of-Eternity/EoEfunc) (`pip install git+https://github.com/End-of-Eternity/EoEfunc.git`)
- [lvsfunc@c90a8a1](https://github.com/Irrational-Encoding-Wizardry/lvsfunc/tree/c90a8a1ebb79b65a93e02ef9e4775698d87de592) (`pip install git+https://github.com/Irrational-Encoding-Wizardry/lvsfunc.git@c90a8a1ebb79b65a93e02ef9e4775698d87de592`)
- [vardefunc@0624065](https://github.com/Ichunjo/vardefunc/blob/06240655d9e01f29a6ea7d48eba49addf1b56f4d/requirements.txt) (`pip install git+https://github.com/Ichunjo/vardefunc.git@06240655d9e01f29a6ea7d48eba49addf1b56f4d`)
- [havsfunc](https://github.com/HomeOfVapourSynthEvolution/havsfunc) (`pip install havsfunc`)
- [kagefunc](https://github.com/Irrational-Encoding-Wizardry/kagefunc) (`vsrepo install kagefunc`)
- [vsutil](https://github.com/Irrational-Encoding-Wizardry/vsutil) (`pip install vsutil`)

All of these (except maybe vsutil?) have unlisted plugin dependancies. There's too many to list here
though. I may try to autogenerate a list of dependancies per-project later on.

You are free to use these scripts however you wish, however I give no guarantees that they will work,
nor that they won't set your machine on fire. If you do use them for anything, credit is much
appreciated.
